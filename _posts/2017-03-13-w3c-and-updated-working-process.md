## New order 

From 1 of March W3C had updated main document, which contains reglamentation how to work with specification: [W3C Process](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/)

Main difference between new one and old one is an explicit possibility to mark old specifications as obsolete or deprecated. It was very hard to get an actual specification today - like specification with HTML 4.01 / 5.0 (actual by Google search) / 5.1 (new one???). In new process such old and deprecated docs will be marked with special label which says that these docs are no more "guides to action". They will be saved only for history opportunity.

Making updates to specifications are also simplified. If previously you should spent a lot of time with drafts and discussions and new changes and corrects will be published to new special page (errata), now new changes which does not broke up specification (eg. some add-ins) you can post up on main page. For more critical changes new version should got through one more stage - candidate in recommendation and after all it becomes “Edited recommendation”.

I believe that new process will change a situation with specification intricacies and its evolution will be more and more simpler
